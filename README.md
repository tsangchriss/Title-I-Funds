Objective: Education is a cornerstone of our country's development and prosperity. Thus, understanding how educational resources are allocated is crucial for ensuring equal opportunities for all students. In the United States, Title I funding plays an important role in this landscape, providing financial assistance to schools with greater numbers of children from low-income families. This project aims to delve into the complexities of Title I funding, exploring its distribution and utilization across different states.  

For this project, I wanted to shed light on the equity and effectiveness of Title I funding. By analyzing and visualizing the allocation and expenditure of these funds, I believe we can gain insights into how well they align with the needs of each state's student population. Moreover, understanding the proportion of total educational expenditures dedicated to Title I programs can reveal the level of emphasis placed on supporting disadvantaged students. Ultimately, the goals are to contribute to discussions on improving educational equity and effectiveness and, hopefully, inform investors and philanthropists looking to understand and contribute to the educational landscape. 

All of the work was done using PgAdmin4 (PostgreSQL) and Tableau.
